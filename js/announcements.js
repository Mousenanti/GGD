            The Navy League is holding their annual Crab Feed Fundraiser at the Alameda Elks Lodge on Friday, March 3rd.  

            If you are interested, please RSVP me at my email: Mattdemartini@yahoo.com  

            The uniform of the day is NWU III.  Arrival time is 5pm.  You will receive 6 volunteer hours towards your community service ribbon.  

            I have included the flyer to the event with the address.  Please RSVP as soon as possible so we can give them a head count of volunteers.  You will be fed at the end of the function.  There is usually plenty of crab and dessert left over.  The cadets who volunteered last year did an outstanding job.

            Unit needs time to plan and purchase meal items in advanced for our large group. If we do not hear from you, we will assume you ARE coming and you will be responsible for paying the $20 for meals. Saturday lunch is always BYO. There may be times the concession stand on the ship is not open and we donâ€™t have control over that, so please plan ahead.    
            
            The meal cost for this February drill will remain $20. Due to continuing price increase of food supplies, going forward a typical drill meal cost will increase to $25. Thank you for your understanding.   
            
            As always, meal response sheet is not where you notify absences.  Continue to follow your Chain of Command for this.    
            
            See you all at the next drill.`,
