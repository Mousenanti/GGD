            Any Sea Cadets who are looking to complete a training before summer, please let us
            know if you would be interested in attending a Recruiting Station Training during your spring break!
            If you just need a training to advance and you were not able to attend this winter, or wont be
            able to this summer, please send an email to knorton@seacadets.org by Saturday March 22nd
            with the following information:
 
                What are the dates of your spring break?
                Did you miss winter training or will you be missing summer training?
                What city do you live in?
                Are you able to drive yourself to this training or will you need to find a ride?

            Please note that this is a "day camp" style training where you will need to find a ride
            to the chosen recruiting station each day for 5 week days.  Once we know who is interested,
            we will see if a central location can be found and which adults we can find to staff as escorts.`,

            If you are interested, please RSVP me at my email: Mattdemartini@yahoo.com  

            The uniform of the day is NWU III.  Arrival time is 5pm.  You will receive 6 volunteer hours towards your community service ribbon.  

            I have included the flyer to the event with the address.  Please RSVP as soon as possible so we can give them a head count of volunteers.  You will be fed at the end of the function.  There is usually plenty of crab and dessert left over.  The cadets who volunteered last year did an outstanding job.

            Unit needs time to plan and purchase meal items in advanced for our large group. If we do not hear from you, we will assume you ARE coming and you will be responsible for paying the $20 for meals. Saturday lunch is always BYO. There may be times the concession stand on the ship is not open and we donâ€™t have control over that, so please plan ahead.    
            
            The meal cost for this February drill will remain $20. Due to continuing price increase of food supplies, going forward a typical drill meal cost will increase to $25. Thank you for your understanding.   
            
            As always, meal response sheet is not where you notify absences.  Continue to follow your Chain of Command for this.
